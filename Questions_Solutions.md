answer 1 :The "gamma_0" and "gamma_1" parameters in Entropy-SGD control the scaling of the penalty term added to the parameter updates to encourage exploration. Specifically, the penalty term is scaled by gamma = gamma_0 * (1 + gamma_1)^t, where t is the current training step.

answer 2: Entropy-SGD uses momentum in its parameter updates in a similar way to other optimizers, where a moving average of past gradients is used to update the current parameters. The specific implementation in Entropy-SGD is given by the "momentum" and "nesterov" parameters. If "momentum" is non-zero, the gradient update is a combination of the current gradient and a momentum term that is a weighted sum of past gradients. If "nesterov" is True, the momentum term is used to adjust the gradient before it is applied to the parameters.

answer 3 :The purpose of the Gaussian noise added to the parameter updates in Entropy-SGD is to encourage exploration of the loss landscape. Specifically, the noise is added to the parameter updates with a scaling factor of sqrt(eta_prime) * epsilon, where "eta_prime" and "epsilon" are hyperparameters. The noise has the effect of adding a random perturbation to the parameter updates, which can help the optimizer escape from local minima.

answer 4 :The "alpha" parameter in Entropy-SGD controls the weight given to the averaged parameters in the final parameter updates. Specifically, the averaged parameters are computed during the optimization process and are used to adjust the current parameters before they are updated based on the gradient. The "alpha" parameter controls how much weight is given to the averaged parameters in this adjustment. A larger value of "alpha" gives more weight to the averaged parameters, which can help stabilize the optimization process.

answer 5: Entropy-SGD modifies the gradient updates based on the distance between the current parameters and the averaged parameters. Specifically, the gradient is adjusted by subtracting the distance between the current parameters and the averaged parameters, multiplied by a penalty term proportional to "gamma". This adjustment has the effect of pulling the current parameters closer to the averaged parameters, which can help stabilize the optimization process.
